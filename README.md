# cassandra-example

### Overview
This tutorial is an introductory guide to the [Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/) database using Java.

This example covers the basic steps to connect to and start working with this NoSQL database from Java.

### Cassandra
>Cassandra is a scalable NoSQL database that provides continuous availability with no single point of failure and gives the ability to handle large amounts of data with exceptional performance.

>This database uses a ring design instead of using a master-slave architecture. In the ring design, there is no master node â€“ all participating nodes are identical and communicate with each other as peers.

>This makes Cassandra a horizontally scalable system by allowing for the incremental addition of nodes without needing reconfiguration.
